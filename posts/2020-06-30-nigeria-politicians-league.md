It has been an interesting week in the Nigerian political sphere as we have witnessed defections and counter defections, a bane of the Nigerian democratic process. This just goes to show that we run a political system where parties have no ideologies and where politicians simply swap one political platform for another because of what’s in it for them in their new platforms.

Defectors advance in the public arena for a number of common reasons to justify their actions, especially their right to keep the seat. These reasons include: that their party has changed while the defector has not, that they are obeying the voters' will, or that they are exercising judgment on behalf of the greater good. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, nor are they exhaustive. In fact, observers would suggest that there are often unspoken self-interested motivations behind the defection.

Evidence suggests that the consequences of defection for politicians are two-fold: they substantially change their behaviour in order to fit with the demands of the new party (if switching to another party), but ultimately their level of support usually falls. In short, defection brings short-term fame but long-term obscurity.

"The ideology deficit in our nation’s politics has far-reaching consequences for the rest of society. Political parties who have no values, no promised manifestoes or no discernible ideologies are not likely to deliver dividends of democracy to the people. Our ideology deficit politics contributes to why we have the decrepit infrastructure and the highest number of poor people in the world. It is why the nation is crumbling before our eyes because you can't hold any political leader to anything." - Jude Egbas

The democratic process will never evolve if politicians continually choose to pursue their own individual agendas. A constant stream of defections undermines the ability of party leaders to maintain coherent policy platforms and may damage the party's reputation with voters, who may withdraw their support from a fractious and divided party.

The importance of party cohesion cannot be overemphasized. Cohesion and discipline matter in the daily running of parties. A difficulty for parties in maintaining cohesion is that parties are comprised of individuals, each of whom is capable of independent action and each of whom has her own set of priorities that may differ from that of the party.

Take Obaseki and Ize-Iyamu for example. Obaseki had run under the platform of the APC in the last election while Ize-Iyamu ran under the platform of the PDP. Funnily enough, both are running under opposite parties this year. One begins to ask, are we running a relay type of election? Have the allegations levied against their person in their previous parties become nullified and void? Have their  "sins" been automatically "washed" away?

Nigeria as the acclaimed "giant of Africa" should look inwards and find a way around. We should not be deceived into believing that defections are in the interests of the citizens. Political defections or decamping have always been a trademark of Nigerian politicians most especially towards the end of each administration for selfish reasons and never in the defense of democracy and this is because of the lack of political ideologies.

Active citizens,  it is time to be on guard and ensure you do not fall for "packaging".
