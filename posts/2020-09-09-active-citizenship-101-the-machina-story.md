Being an active citizen transcends word of mouth; it takes action. It is the will of citizens to make positive impacts in their community.

Kevin Odanz, a popular Nigerian influencer, shared a tale of what some young Nigerians in Yobe did to foster change in their community, beyond social media outrage.

This particular community in Yobe State called Machina had just one healthcare facility serving about 15,000 people. The healthcare centre had no electricity, no running water, was understaffed, had a shortage of drugs and equipment. Doctors there had to literally use torchlights to perform surgeries, critical cases had to be referred to Nguru about 3 hours away. It was that bad!

In 2017, the Border Communities Development Agency (BCDA), appropriated the construction of a Primary Healthcare Centre with a solar-powered borehole system.

So, a group of young people started an advocacy campaign called #EquipMachina to get to the root of the issue and address it. It began with asking questions about all the public funds that were duly approved for the community, who is responsible, and what happened to the money. They started digging, using the internet and other resources.

Connected Development (CODE), sent a freedom of information request to BCDA on October 16, 2017, requesting for details of the bid (contract document, successful contractors and actual project amount). CODE further went to write petitions to the Senate, Federal House of Representatives, Office of the Auditor General of the Federation, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC).

Of course, where there is a will, there is a way! You never know how far you can go if you are determined and have this magic tool called the internet. They were able to get enough data and evidence to begin advocacy both online and offline.

TVC ran a documentary on this story, courtesy of CODE with EiE spearheading the documentary and Trust Africa assisting with funds.

It was that simple...well, not so simple. A lot of behind-the-scenes work went into it, using valuable networks. But today? Machina Primary Healthcare Centre was reconstructed, electricity fixed, water now runs there and they have better health services.

So what can you do as a Nigerian youth? When you go to your community and find some public projects where you know funds have been misappropriated and it is affecting your community, gather your data, do your research, trace the funds and start a campaign.

If just 10,000 of us do this every year, the result will shock you. It is simple! It is your right and civic responsibility to track public funds. It should be a norm for us because the money is from our tax and our shared resources. In fact, it is our "oyel" money.

Ask questions on what government-funded project is in your community". Be an active citizen in words and action!
