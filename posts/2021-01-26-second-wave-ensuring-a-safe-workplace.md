title: 'Second Wave: Ensuring A Safe Workplace'
---
The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in new hotspots and, from all indications, it may last longer than the first wave.

As an employer, it is important getting your workplace ready and safe especially if your staff are not working remotely. It is imperative that you create an environment that is ‘COVID-secure’ in order to meet your health and safety obligations as an employer. This means that you will need to conduct regular risk assessments to ensure that you are taking all reasonable steps to keep your staff safe.

As this period of uncertainty continues, it will be very important to maintain an open line of communication and take the following steps:

* It is important to reassure staff that the workplace is ‘COVID-secure’. Ensure that they understand exactly the measures have been taken – Good ventilation and circulation of fresh air at an appropriately warm temperature; Allowing enough space for staff to practice social distancing. This can be done by spacing workstations 2 metres apart and providing floor markings/signs to help staff to maintain a distance in communal areas; Physical barriers where appropriate, e.g. Screens between desks; Cleaning stations, particularly around communal facilities such as printers and photocopiers; Use of PPE where appropriate (e.g. in areas where social distancing is not possible); Sufficient handwashing facilities and hand sanitiser points to allow staff to wash their hands regularly.
* You should reassure staff that contingency plans are in place for various eventualities.
* Be aware of how your employees are commuting to work – those with higher-risk commutes (e.g. getting BRT buses or danfo at rush hour) or with health-related vulnerabilities may need to be given additional flexibility. If the infection rate increases, staff in these categories may need to return to remote working or work varied hours to lower the risk posed to them.
* The rules on lockdown change frequently, and an outbreak can happen in an instant. Therefore, you should ensure you have up-to-date personal contact details for all staff in case you need to contact them in an emergency, e.g. to ask them to stay at home. Also, a register should be made available to record visitors within your office premises daily to help with contact-tracing in the case of an outbreak. 
* It is important to explain to staff what your approach will be if they must self-isolate, particularly where they are unable to work from home, e.g. in terms of their sick pay entitlement. You should also establish a wellbeing plan to deal with any adverse impact on staff mental health, as reinstatement of lockdown would likely be very difficult for many people.
* Ensure you have a clear containment procedure and enough staff trained to deal with a potential outbreak on your premises. As well as boosting staff confidence that their health and safety is being protected, this will help you to reduce the risk of the virus being spread and the numbers of employees who would have to self-isolate as a result. You could also consider whether, from a cost and practicality perspective, workplace testing is viable.

Remember that you also owe health and safety responsibilities to employees working from home, so check in with them to ensure that they have everything they need to work safely and comfortably.
