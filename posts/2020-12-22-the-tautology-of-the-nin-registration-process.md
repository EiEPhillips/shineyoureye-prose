title: The Tautology Of The Nin Registration Process
---
The world is advancing, technology has made things easier – for most countries, technology has made it easier capturing data of citizens. After all, internet users leave traces of their data on the internet. Alas, for a country like Nigeria, the reverse is the case. 

On Wednesday, December 16th, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami through the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has given telecommunications operators (MTN, Glo, Airtel, 9Mobile and others) two weeks to block at least 20 million unique subscribers who are not registered with National Identity Numbers (NINs).

Paradigm Initiative (PIN) in conjunction with Enough is Enough Nigeria (EiE Nigeria) had called on the federal government to assign NINs to Nigerians using existing data – Bank Verification Number (BVN) plus Drivers' License or Passport number or Voters' Card number. Others would then manually register. The federal government refused and insisted on everyone registering and it has been a very stressful process for most Nigerians.

In July 2020, Nigeria had 198.9 million active lines with an estimated 66.3 million unique subscribers. By October 2020, 42 million Nigerians had been issued NINs. Even if the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) increased enrolment from 500,000 to 2.5 million per month, current numbers will be at 47 million NINs. There is a 20 million shortfall that the government wants to bridge in 2 weeks – how is that possible? Let's not forget there is a second wave of COVID19 coupled with the holiday season – how will this feat be accomplished?

The process of adding another line to an existing NIN is arduous. A lot of Nigerians will take the easy route out – which is – ditch their second lines. This will have a negative ripple effect on businesses as there will be lower revenues and unemployment. The federal government will also fine telcos that do not comply with the directive. How does this make Nigeria an enabling environment for business?

Nigeria has no Data Privacy and Protection law. Even though there is a Nigerian Data Protection Regulation, it is secondary legislation by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), which does not have the powers to establish an independent Data Protection Authority. As it is with the case of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), citizens' sensitive data have been lost without an opportunity to seek redress but Nigeria continues to demand biometric information. 

An attempt was made earlier this year at making NIN mandatory for UTME but the NIMC became overwhelmed and had to cancel. This is to show how herculean a task it would be to achieve the feat of enrolling citizens who do not have NINs in just two weeks.

On the way forward, the following is recommended:

●	Halt the Mandatory Requirement Immediately.
●	Use existing biometric registration to assign NINs and notify citizens on their status.
●	All Telcos should have a process to remotely connect NIN to active numbers. 
●	Nigerians should accelerate the legislative process for the draft Data Privacy and Protection Bill into law.

There will be too much pain and suffering if citizens get cut off. Some people hate working remotely. So, there will be job loss and economic hardship.

Finally, The ICT sector, one of the few sectors contributing to the country's GDP during a recession, will be badly hit if almost 20 million people get cut off.
