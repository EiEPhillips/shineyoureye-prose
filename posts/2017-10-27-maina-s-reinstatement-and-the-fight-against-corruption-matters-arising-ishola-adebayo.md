Public outcry continues to trail the turn of event in the Nigeria’s polity, this time, over the recent reinstatement of the former Chairman of Presidential Committee on Pension Reform Task force Team (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina, into the federal civil service, thereby accusing President Muhammadu Buhari of aiding corruption in his government by earlier feigning ignorance of his reinstatement and promotion only to sack him after continuous public vituperation.

Mr Maina was posted a few days ago to the Ministry of Interior by the Office of the Head of Service (HoS) in an Acting capacity to fill a vacancy created following the retirement of the Director heading the Human Resources Department in the Ministry. It will be recalled that Maina’s last posting was with the Ministry of Interior, and that is probably why he was re-posted back to the Ministry.

In 2013, Maina was declared wanted by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) in connection with N2 billion pension scam in the Office of Head of Service of the Federation. A check on the EFCC’s website shows Mr Maina is still wanted for the alleged stated crime.

“The public is hereby notified that Abdulrasheed Abdullahi Maina, former Chairman of Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), whose photograph appears above, is wanted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for offences bordering on Procurement Fraud and Obtaining by False Pretence,” the EFCC stated on its website.

While Nigerians are still asking questions as to what has happened to the report of the committee that investigated the $43 million discovered in an apartment at Osbourne Towers, Ikoyi, Lagos, allegation of $25 billion was made by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Ibe Kachikwu, Suspended Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal probe’s report and as usual, the allegation like others before it, is being treated as family affairs.

When is PMB’s government turning its anti-corruption searchlight on members of the All Peoples Congress?

With this and other corruption cases, citizens are concerned about how it seems corruption is gaining upper hand in the country. Although President Buhari promised to fight the malice with all his willpower, but it looks like the table is now turning around.

This situation among others is making the citizenry to ask why some corruption cases in the current government are yet to be resolved. It is however hope that the fight against corruption is not lost yet.
