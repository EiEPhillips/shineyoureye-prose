title: The Never-ending Cycle Of Vote Buying

On Saturday, December 5, 2020, bye-elections held across 15 senatorial districts and constituencies in Nigeria. The elections may have come and gone, but one problem sticks out like a sore thumb among the other problems Nigeria faces during elections – vote-buying.

According to Frederic Charles Schaffer, a vote is literally “bought” or “sold” depending on whether one adopts the perspective of the candidate or the voter. The act of vote-buying by this view is a contract, or perhaps an auction in which the voter sells his or her vote to the highest bidder.

For a country where 40% of its people lived below its poverty line of 137,430 Naira ($381.75) a year according to a report about poverty and inequality from September 2018 to October 2019 by the National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria seems to have been ensnared in the brutal hands of stomach infrastructure. How do you convince a poor man who has no food not to collect 500 naira in exchange for his vote? After all, things have gone so bad that votes are now equivalent to goods – candidates buy and electorates sell votes. Candidates do not even make efforts to win the hearts of the electorates, they wait until election day to hand out peanuts because they see poverty as a tool.

Money has become a dominant, determinant factor in Nigeria’s politics. The poor are likely to be victimized by vote-buying because their limited means makes them susceptible to material inducements, including offers of basic commodities or modest amounts of money.

The evidence that vote-buying is principally aimed at the poor is virtually uncontested. How then do we curb this menace?

Vote-buying drives up the costs of elections for parties and candidates and may prevent credible candidates from running for political office. Most importantly, it breeds cynicism among voters, who feel disenfranchised by a corrupted system that fails to adhere to democratic ideals.

We must, as active citizens, take it upon ourselves to enlighten the electorates on the ills of selling their votes. This enlightenment must start from the grassroots. The market woman should know that when she collects 500 Naira in exchange for her vote, she sells the rights of her children. Let them know that what they are receiving is just for the moment but the outcome of their decisions will last a lifetime. 

We can consider exploring options finding politicians guilty of vote-buying, imprisoning them or simply barring them from running for political offices.

Finally, the nation needs electoral reforms. Electronic voting will solve most of the dysfunction in our electoral processes. We must begin to mount pressure on our elected officials to push for electoral reforms because if left on their own, they would not want to disrupt a corrupt system that brought them into power.

Looking on the bright side, the public hearing on electoral amendment headed by the National Assembly Joint Committee on INEC and Electoral Matters was held on December 9, 2020 and one of the things that were stressed was the power to review election results declared under duress. This, is believed, will deter politicians from compelling polling officials to false results under duress. Stakeholders also reiterated the need to confer legality on electronic accreditation of voters using smart card reader to reduce multiple voting and voting by proxy.
