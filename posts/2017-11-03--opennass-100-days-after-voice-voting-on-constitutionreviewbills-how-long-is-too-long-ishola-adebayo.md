"We also believe that we will like to see more cases of electronic voting as opposed to voice voting". - Bukola Saraki (Chairman, National Assembly) May 19, 2017.

Friday, November 3, 2017 makes it exactly 100 days after the National Assembly voted clause by clause in the ongoing amendment to Nigeria’s 1999 Constitution; the voting records are yet to be made public. 

The demand for an open government which is transparent is crucial; the revelation of identity of lawmakers who voted against passage of some crucial bills that have some bearing on the question of restructuring for citizens in both chambers of the National Assembly should be done forthwith, as it is at the heart of an open legislative process. Legislators are public officials and are expected to honour the principles of transparency and accountability which the Senate President promised severally to adhere hitherto in replacing voice voting with electronic voting so citizens can track their representatives.

Non disclosure of list of lawmakers who voted YES or NAY and the failed amendments in devolution of powers, state creation and boundary adjustment, indigeneship and citizenship, and deletion of the Land Use Act from the constitution, are biggest misses by the 8th National Assembly.

The National Assembly has voted on the Constitution Review Bills, citizens are however demanding that #OurNASS makes public the voting details of the entire constitution review bill considered. Why is it taking the National Assembly an eternity to make public their voting records on #ConstitutionReviewBills? #OpenNASS demands that the National Assembly makes public their voting records. 

We have a Senate with 109 Senators with each of the 36 states represented by 3 senators and the Federal Capital Territory (Abuja) with 1 senator. The House of Representatives has 360 members with the number of representatives from each state dependent on land size and population.

Primarily, these representatives should vote in line with their constituents’ priorities, and should also be held accountable by these same constituents based on their voting record, particularly as it pertains to the amendment of Nigeria’s Constitution. Over 20,000 Nigerians have signed the petition demanding for an #OpenNASS.
