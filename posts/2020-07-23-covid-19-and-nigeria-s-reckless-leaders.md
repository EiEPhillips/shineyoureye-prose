Whenever news of leaders flouting safety protocols filters into my ears, the words of Albert Schweitzer comes to mind, "The three most important ways to lead people are: by example… by example… by example." 

If there is one thing the Pandemic has brought to light, it is that our leaders only like us to do as they say, not do as they do. How else can you explain these Instances?:

Let us not forget that Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media, ignored the directive to shun large gatherings and maintain social distancing as he was seen on 21st March giving a speech at Barewa Old Boys Association.

Close on his heels, Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, Hosted the Southwest Zonal rally of the PDP on 18th March, with over a thousand people in attendance. He also attended a National Executive Council (NEC) meeting on March 19th and a PDP caucus meeting on March 22nd. He later tested positive for COVID-19 on March 24th.

Remember Sale Mamman the Minister for Power? He returned to Nigeria from Germany with Abba Kyari on March 14th and refused to self-isolate as enshrined in the NDDC Public Health Advisory 4, and attended a Federal Executive Council (FEC)  meeting on  March 18th.

Like his colleagues, Bala Mohammed, Bauchi State Governor returned from Germany on March 15th and ignored the NDDC guidelines to self-isolate, thus endangering those that came in contact with him.

While the NDDC was still reiterating the importance of social distancing, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, the Governor of Enugu State, celebrated his birthday on March 20th in a compact room (the idea of social distancing was thrown out of the roof)

Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma decided that swearing-in was more important than COVID-19 as he was seen swearing-in 23 commissioners, 89 Special Advisers and Senior Special Assistants on March 23rd while refusing to practice social distancing.

We also recall that Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu breached safety protocols, sneezing in public without wearing a face mask as seen in a video online on June 29th, and tested positive days after. 

Recently, Adamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri and his entourage violated COVID-19 protocol at the Port Harcourt International Airport on July 16th by refusing to have their temperature checked and sanitized at the airport, while former Zamfara governor, Abdulaziz Yari, also allegedly breached protocols at the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport on July 11th when he refused an officer disinfecting his luggage.

We see the rising statistics of infected persons being churned out daily by the NDDC and we wonder how. We cannot expect to flatten the curve when our leaders are single-handedly championing the spread. It is not enough to give directives. How are we following them?
