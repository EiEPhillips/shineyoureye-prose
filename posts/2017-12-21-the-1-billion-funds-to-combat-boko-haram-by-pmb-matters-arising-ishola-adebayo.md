  The $1 Billion Funds to combat Boko Haram by PMB: Matters Arising! -Ishola

The decision by President Muhammadu Buhari to borrow $ 1 billion to fight against the Boko Haram sect in the North East is causing a lot of ripples in the country especially as another general election cycle is in the offing. 

It would be recalled that the money approved by the National Economic Council, NEC, last week would be sourced from the Excess Crude Account, ECA.

It is however hard to say if the move is justified or not to spend such a huge amount of money to continue to fight Boko Haram. But one sacrosanct thing is that even great nations of the world have continued to spend a lot of money combating terrorists. The United States has been spending a lot of money to fight terror and it is believe the fight against terror is an endless fight.

But we don’t know how long it will take Nigeria to fight Boko Haram and if truly they are fighting terrorism. If we have some competent hands with great strategies fighting this war, then we can say the war will be won one day.

Even with timeline of Boko Haram attacks below in Borno between the month of June and July in 2017 alone and the circumstances surrounding the use of such huge amount to tackle Boko Haram insurgency which it claims has already been defeated requires critical scrutiny: 

•	June 8 – 13 killed, 24 injured in three suicide attacks on Jiddari/Polo general area of Maiduguri metropolis. The incident takes place as Acting President Yemi Osibanjo launches FG’s Food Intervention Programme for IDPs in the Borno State capital. 

•	June 19 – 17 persons, including five female suicide bombers, dead and 11 injured in Kofa village attacks. 

•	June 20 – 14 women, mostly police officers, are kidnapped while scores are killed as insurgents ambush motorists along Maiduguri- Damboa- Biu Road while conveying the corpse of the late Seargent Rahila Antakirya to Lassa village in Askira -Uba LGA for burial. 

•	June 25 -16 persons, including a security guard attached to UNIMAID, killed in separate attacks on the campus and surrounding communities of Kaleri, Muna Garage general area. 

•	July 7 – Security operatives repel suicide attacks on UNIMAID, leaving two bombers dead. 

•	July 12 – 4 female suicide bombers, 12 Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) members and 7 villagers are killed while 23 others are injured in Molai Kura on the outskirts of Maiduguri metropolis. 

•	July 16 – Boko Haram kills one and injures another in a clash on a grazing land on the outskirts of Maiduguri. 

•	July 25 – Over 40 people, comprising of 16 CJTF members, 20 soldiers and five UNIMAID, staff are killed, scores injured while three UNIMAID staff are abducted in Boko Haram ambush on their way home after participating in in oil exploration mission around Bornoyesu village of Magumeri LGA of Borno State.

The terror war continues and it consumes a lot of money, time and even precious lives are lost combating these people. But those in the government must know that they hold power in trust for the people and that is why they have to do everything in the interest of the people. The anti-terrorism fight will consume a lot of resources, but our leaders must not use that as an opportunity to milk the nation dry.
