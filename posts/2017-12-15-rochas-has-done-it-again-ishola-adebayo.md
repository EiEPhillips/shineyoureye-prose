Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo state has conferred his younger sister, Ogechi Ololo (nee Okorocha), as the Commissioner for Happiness and Couples' Fulfillment. She was among 27 new commissioners and 27 transition committee chairmen for the 27 local government councils in the state sworn in by the governor on Monday, December 4. What sin did Imo people commit to deserve this embarrassment as their Governor?

Before her new appointment, she served as the governor’s deputy chief of staff and special adviser on domestic matters. She was also the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate into the House of Representatives for the Owerri federal constituency seat in 2015 and has served in various capacities since Okorocha became the state governor in 2011.

With this recent episode in the dramatic life of Governor Rochas, one is no doubt left with little choice but to conclude that Rochas Okorocha is a perfect example of why all aspirants to high offices in Nigeria should submit themselves for psychiatric evaluation before being permitted to contest.

But coming back to reality though, these are the types of tales you expect to see being dramatised in badly written Nollywood movies of the Idumota variety. Now I know what people mean when they say that no matter how strange fiction is, reality is often stranger than fiction.

We say congratulations to all the people of Imo state on this development. Happiness is the heartbeat of life. Henceforth, nobody in Imo state has any reason to be sad again. There is now a whole Ministry devoted to making you all happy! Because nothing comes reassuring like spending N520 million on statues and appointing 27 mediocre to further spend Imo state funds at the moonlight of another election cycle.

Not too worry, the governor already urged the new appointees to prove their worth in the service of Imo state and her people. He also assured the citizens of Imo State that his administration’s achievement surpasses those of all the previous administrations in the state, both civilian and military put together.

Citizens of Imo State must take notice that the their state ranks near the bottom in all important indices 
of socio-economic development despite the leader’s grandiose schemes and appearances and despite all the tall tales that we are told by propagandists of the state in several media channels. It is time for the citizens to shine their eyes to the misdoings of the Statue Erecting Governor by demanding for accountability, transparency and good governance. 

Ndi Imo, your Governor has done it again. When will you say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH?
