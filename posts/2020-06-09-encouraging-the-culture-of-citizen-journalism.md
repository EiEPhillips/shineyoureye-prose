Imagine you're walking by Abiola Garden and an Occupy Naija protest suddenly forms a few feet from you and you decide to pull out your camera phone and video tape the incident, and then provide it to a news outlet or share it on social media – You've just contributed to citizen journalism. We live in the age of image consumption and data absorption. Everyday, a fresh wave of information reaches our computers and phone screens, but not only are we the recipients of this constant flow, we are now the creators.

A decade ago, the term "citizen journalism" was nearly as mainstream as mainstream news itself. But what does it mean today?We say everyone is a reporter nowadays, but what does that really mean in practice?

Citizen journalism is the dissemination of information by people who are not professional journalists. Citizens reporters do not do this kind of journalism because it is their job, but because of the way they want to improve society. Citizen journalism is the basis of democracy that encourages citizens to actively participate in social processes. It refers to all forms of public reporting carried out online which includes everything from blogs covering a local government election in Zamfara to the online posts of citizens in countries where the national media is government controlled. When an event is too small for larger media to take notice or the media cannot report the facts without censorship, citizen journalism may be the only source of information on what is actually occurring behind the media "blackout". It provides an Avenue for people to access information about breaking news stories at a much quicker speed than before. Furthermore, the public can now see real life footage of these events as they unfold. The reason for this is undoubtedly that citizens are now playing an active role in the process of collecting, reporting and analysing news. The introduction and intelligence of smart phones enables citizens who are at the scene to report breaking news more rapidly than news teams.

Recently, there was a campaign on social media platforms on rape with many people coming out to share personal stories on the issue and it brought to light the rot in the system when it comes to enforcement of the law regarding such crimes and prosecution of offenders. Citizens used their platforms to cover rape stories and demand justice for affected persons. People who could not tell their stories due to stigmatization and fear were able to voice out and provide leads that could assist the police with investigation and prosecution. 

A video also surfaced online of the shooting of Tina by a trigger happy police officer at Iyana Oworo. If the video had not been captured, there would have been little evidence to show.

The advent of the Internet has signalled a significant shift in collecting and sharing information, and allowed anyone to share and spread their personal experience of an event, in real time. This new form of reporting takes place ahead of or outside traditional media structures, and functions as a firewall by holding media accountable for any inaccuracies or lack of news coverage. 

Through citizen journalism, the individual gains a new position in the course of an event, media, history and in the political sphere. By taking responsibility and power over information, citizen journalists question the centralisation of information.

YouTube launched a special channel called YouTube Reporter’s center, where citizens are able to look at a number of video tutorials in which, by some of the leading experts in the field of journalism explaining how to do amateur journalism, ie. civic journalism. It covered a number of topics, from finding ideas for stories, technical implementation, presenting stories, etc. 

But while the media often welcomes content from citizen journalists, there are times when it seems to hinder professional reporting. The ease with which citizens can upload content online makes it infinitely impossible to verify sources and information, and has given rise to an onslaught of fake news. Sifting through what is true or not has made traditional media and their ability to independently verify information indelibly more important. Even amidst the social media storm, news outlets are using tried and true techniques to check information uploaded online before republishing it.

User generated content, digital storytelling and consistently available live streaming is fuelling the news with different events from different perspectives.

While the future of the news and how it is defined is constantly in flux, citizen journalism appears to be here to stay and the media needs to have a serious conversation about what good reporting is and how to maintain professional integrity. citizen journalism can be considered as the offspring of this evolution. It is an alternative form of news gathering and reporting, taking place outside of the traditional media structures and which can involve anyone.
