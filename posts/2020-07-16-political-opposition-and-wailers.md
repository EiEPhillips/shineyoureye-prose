Opposition groups are the check on the ruling party in a healthy democracy. A party that is not in the government either directly or indirectly is treated to be an opposition party. Opposition parties bring to the fore the mistakes of the ruling party and they are supposed to provide better alternatives.

The opposition’s main role is to question the government of the day and hold them accountable to the public. It represents an alternative government and is responsible for challenging the policies of the government and producing different policies where appropriate.

Since the government has to remain answerable to the public at all times, good opposition can bring to light, serious issues and have them resolved quickly. It also debates legislation vigorously in the house and during the select committee processes to ensure the legislation receives careful consideration.

According to a renowned Author, R. K. Narayan, opposition parties play the role of a Mother In Law inside the house who keeps on following the Daughter In Law ( in this case The Ruling Party) throughout the house, pointing out the flaws in her attempts of keeping the house neat and tidy and the kitchen shinny.

If there will be no opposition to the policies formulated by the government, it will lead to the end of democracy. Simply, democracy will be converted to feudalism, monarchism, or totalitarianism. To avoid these scenarios, there should be constructive criticisms that go to help a lot within and outside the political institution. Without opposition, the democratic set up is of no use. People in the seats become tyrannical.

Being an opposition is not just about opposing the incumbent government there are times the incumbent government and the opposition agree on certain policies and legislations. If the solution proposed by the government has wide support, logical and has the interest of citizens at heart, then it is only natural for the opposition to agree.

The other major role is proposing alternatives to what the government is doing so the public gets the benefit of political debate between different directions.

In Nigeria, we neither have in my estimation a constructive or a disruptive opposition. Whatever we have that may look remotely as any form of opposition is weak, uncoordinated, and ineffective. Our political parties are internally polarized, politics has become evil, our political leaders do not know where to draw the line, the ruling government is having an upper hand, it is committed to unrelenting, overzealous persecution of the opposition and progressive ideas.  The last time we witnessed what looked like organized opposition, even if it was disruptive was in 2013. A number of political parties formed a synergy to become the APC All Progressives Congress (APC) and adopting an “oppose, oppose, oppose” strategy, they managed by 2015 to get the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP) out of power.  It was a major turning point in Nigerian politics since the return to civilian rule in 1999 – Reuben Abati.

In conclusion, the opposition parties need to wake up and prioritize their mandate which is to offer political alternatives; articulate and promote the interests of citizens; offer alternatives to the decisions proposed by the government and the majority representative; improve parliamentary decision-making procedures by ensuring debate, reflection and contradiction; scrutinise the legislative and budgetary proposals of the government; supervise and oversee the government and the administration; enhance stability, legitimacy, accountability and transparency in the political processes.

There is more to being an opposition than throwing shades on social media. Less talk, more action.
