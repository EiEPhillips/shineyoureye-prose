title: 'Civil Society Organizations: A Voice In The Wilderness'

This week makes it one month since the #LekkiShootings which stemmed from the nationwide protests against police brutality.

The #EndSARS protests seem to have ebbed; People have gone back to their businesses, the #5for5 demands have not been met, rogue officers responsible for extrajudicial killings are walking freely, reports of uniformed men extorting citizens are still prevalent, and the dead have been buried â€“ their families left with painful memories and thoughts of what could have been. The government may have resumed its "unlooking" stance but like a voice crying out in the wilderness, Civil Society Organizations remain unrelenting in their quest for justice.

The government did a 360 degree turn on its promise to dialogue with protesters and reach favorable consensus when it froze the accounts of individuals and organizations linked with the protests, seized the passports of some individuals and arrested the ones that they could apprehend. This violation of human rights was challenged by a coalition of 32 CSOs that released a statement calling for the government to cease targeted attacks. 

In a country like Nigeria where lawlessness prevails, the importance of CSOs cannot be overemphasized. They continue to stay in course even when the "noise" has died down. They continue to assume that lone, piercing voice in the wilderness.
