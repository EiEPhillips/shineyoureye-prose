Words on the street are that you're more likely to be shot by SARS operatives than you would by armed robbers. This statement is coming from a place of pain and fear from Nigerians. It's heartbreaking and sadly, a reality.

SARS is a branch of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), the highest investigative department of the Nigerian Police Force (NPF). It was created to combat violent crimes like armed robbery and kidnapping, yet is responsible for widespread torture, extortion and abuse of the very citizens it is meant to protect. The abuse of power displayed by SARS officers does not stop at unlawful arrests and extortion but has evolved into murder. People have reported being accosted by SARS officers for displaying body tattoos, piercings, wearing tightly-fitted clothes, carrying a laptop, or even using a backpack

Recall the #EndSARS campaign in November 2017 on social media platforms? Well, it's déjà vu. We're back just where we started. Dreadful stories have surfaced online of their brutality but this time around, the Nigerian youths have activated #OfficeOfTheCitizen.

"A wave of outrage had been fuelled over the last week by the emergence online of graphic footage and shared experiences of abuses by the SARS.

#EndSars began as a largely online movement, trending internationally on social media and gaining the support of figures including the footballer Marcus Rashford and the actor John Boyega. Many of those marching in Lagos and cities across Nigeria have been in their 20s and 30s, protesting for the first time and spurred by personal experiences of or connections with abuses by the security forces." – Emmanuel Akinwotu.

The cooperation and coordination of these protests are worth commending. Funds were raised for refreshments, medicals, logistics, etc., and efforts of Nigerian celebrities like Falz, Runtown, Davido, Small Doctor, Mr Macaroni, Tiwa Savage and other well-meaning Nigerians in leading protests at different points, cannot be overlooked. As the days went by, peaceful protests became bloody as rogue officers opened fire on some protesters among which was a 10-year-old.

President Buhari has reacted to the on-going #EndSARS protests, directing the IG of Police to address the concerns of Nigerians. He also said disbanding the unit is the first step in reforming the police. 
Despite the teargas, hot water, bullets and threats, the Nigerian youths have shown the unwillingness to shed the aluta spirit, amidst the "audio" promises to disband the unit, until their demands are met.

The protests are scheduled to continue until all five demands are met.

Nigeria’s Constitution lays out how security officials are to treat Nigerians held in their custody; “Every individual is entitled to respect for the dignity of his person, and accordingly, no person shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment.” – Section 34 (1) of the constitution.

We are not at war. We should feel safe with security operatives, not threatened.
