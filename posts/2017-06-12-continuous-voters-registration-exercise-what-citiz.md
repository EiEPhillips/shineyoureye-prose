On April 27th, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) commenced the continuous voters’ registration exercise at its 774 local government offices across the country and remains continuous all year round. 

The Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) is an exercise meant for the registration of citizens who turned 18 years of age after the last registration exercise; or those who for one reason or another could not register in the previous exercise.

The 2010 Electoral Act (as amended) mandates the electoral body to carry out CVR process nationwide and after each year, the names and addresses of each person registered during that year should be made available to every political party within 60 days. 

The main activities of the ongoing Nationwide CVR are to make fresh registration, transfer and distribution of Permanent Voters Card (PVCs).

Focusing on the logistics and operational mode of the electoral umpire, the Continuous Voter Registration exercise is been carried out at the INEC Local Government offices and designated centres between the hours of 9.00am and 3.00pm daily, Mondays to Fridays, excluding public holidays.

To be considered eligible for the CVR, the followings are required: 

•	Be a citizen of Nigeria.

•	Attained the age of 18 years, on or before the registration day.

•	Above 18 years and could not register in any of the previous registration exercise. 

•	Resident, works in, or originate from the LGA/Area Council or RA/Ward covered by the Registration Area Centre. 

•	Not subject to any legal incapacity to vote under any law, rules or regulations in force in Nigeria. 

•	The person must present him/her self to the CVR officers for registration and is able to provide proof of identity, age and nationality, if requested.

In cases where citizen has registered before but his/her name/photograph/fingerprints were not captured; such a person must provide his/her Temporary Voters Card (TVC) and such a person has PVC or TVC but names not on Register of Voters.

It is hoped that citizens who have not registered before now will avail themselves the opportunity of the CVR and get registered so they can exercise their electoral franchise as a citizen and those who are already registered not to do so again as registering more than once, is an offence.
