title: 'Cyber Fraud In Nigeria: What You Need To Know'

Every advantage has a disadvantage. With increased internet access and smartphone use in Nigeria, organized crime networks are exploiting vulnerabilities within and outside cyberspace.

Sometime in June this year, the United States sanctioned six Nigerians over $6m cyber fraud, and in the same month, the Dubai Police arrested Ramon Abbass alongside eleven (11) of his gang members for cyber fraud. The gang was responsible for Dh1.6 billion (about N169 billion) fraud involving over 1.9 million victims. For a country that is still suffering from the "yahoo yahoo" stigmatization, it is a heavy blow.

Before we explore the effect of this heinous crime, we need to have an idea of what it entails. What is Cyber fraud?

Cyber fraud, simply put, is any type of illegal activity that takes place via digital means. It is committed with the intent to corrupt another individual or organization's financial information stored online. It offers a tantalizingly quick, easy, and low-risk way to make money and in a country like Nigeria where law enforcement officers are perceived to be corrupt, the possibility of detection is even lower. Surprisingly, contrary to the notion that a crime such as this is masterminded by geeky computer wizards or "gurus", cyber fraud is popular amongst persons with little or no technical expertise, given the vast array of dubious services for hire at relatively low cost.

Cyber fraud firms that supply stolen identification, hacking and code-breaking software and encryption devices openly advertise their services and, like legitimate online retailers, provide hotlines and live chat support. Tutorials on YouTube on how to commit basic fraud are freely available and criminal gangs are offering webinars on how to evade arrest, according to McAfee Vice President, Raj Samani.

The Nigerian society is not helping matters, as well as people with questionable sources of income, are not investigated. They are celebrated in the society and these fraudsters allegedly sponsor the entertainment industry and do a lot of giveaways. Most of them even employ security details to cover their suspicious activities. What do you make of a society that encourages songs that glorify fraud? You are simply enabling them! And we wonder why some businesses outside of Nigeria do not engage in online transactions with Nigeria. It is because of fear of being defrauded.

Several methods are employed in carrying out this activity, one of which involves a phishing scam of emails designed to look like they had come from friends and colleagues, to obtain passwords.

Cyber fraud clearly has damaging effects for those who fall victim, but how far does the problem spread and how damaging can it be?  One thing these criminals fail to note is that when crime goes online it can generate serious challenges for poorer populations, many of whom are increasingly online and the victims of cyber fraud tend to be individuals and small and middle-sized companies, not the banks and large corporations that have the capacity to invest large resources on securing their online systems.

Even though the level of awareness of cyber threats has increased, and law enforcement acts to combat them, illegal profits have reached amazing figures. The impact to society has become unsustainable, considering the global economic crisis. The cost of a malicious cyber activity is mainly related to the theft of intellectual property and the loss of financial assets.

Let us as a nation begin to change the narrative. How? By discouraging illegal ways of acquiring wealth and expose those that are involved. It does not help anyone if we continue missing opportunities just because of the greediness of a few.
