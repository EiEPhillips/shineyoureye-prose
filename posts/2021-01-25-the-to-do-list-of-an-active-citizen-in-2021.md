title: The To-do List Of An Active Citizen In 2021
---
In 2020, thousands participated in the #EndSARS movement in Nigeria, countless others stood against the #SocialMediaBill, and NGOs like EiE Nigeria in collaboration with citizens, strived towards building a better Nigeria. While it is no secret that the year came with major setbacks for governance and human rights, the efforts of active citizens were what kept the fight against these alive.

As you make your resolutions and set goals for the year, here is a list of practical things you could do to keep that effort strong and direct it towards change.

●	Donate 3-5% of your monthly income to a cause you are passionate about. Donating time to an organization feels great and does make an impact, but donating money allows for that impact to grow even when you do not have time to spare. One great organization to support is Enough is Enough Nigeria - an organization dedicated to promoting good governance and government accountability -, or anything you care about or know could use some extra funds.
●	Vote in literally every election you are eligible to vote. Low voter’s turnout.
●	Organize. Individuals have the power to make a lot of positive change, but it is groups that have truly driven the course of activism. There is strength in numbers for achieving your goals.
●	Read more. Whether you read history books about the civil war or daily news on Channels TV, an understanding of where we have been, the types of things people have done, and what is happening today can help inform more impactful, productive action.
●	Consider becoming more politically involved — perhaps by volunteering for a candidate you support. Attend town hall meetings.
●	Take care of yourself. Burnout is real. Unless you take care of yourself and your mental wellness, you will not be healthy enough to take care of anyone else.
