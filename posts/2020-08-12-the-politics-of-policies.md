title: The Politics Of Policies

A policy is a principle or course of action proposed or implemented by a governing body. It is a rule or principle that seeks to better guide decisions, resulting in positive outcomes that enhance good or bad governance. Policies are not laws, but they can lead to laws.

I came across a tweet a while back that hilariously captured a sad reality. It read "Nothing survives in Nigeria. Not dreams, not viruses" and this brought an even sadder reality to mind – policies rarely survive in Nigeria...well, not good ones. "Why?" one might ask. Well, there are many reasons why.

Continuity is not in the vocabulary of most Nigerian politicians. Most politicians just want to win elections. They care less on enforcing viable cum feasible policies that will see to the growth of the nation. What this constant change of power results in is a partial or total disruption of the policies of the previous administration. In most cases, it is a case of wanting to enact their own policies rather than continue with the policies of their predecessors, whether good or bad. A good example is the Abuja- Kaduna railway which has caused a back and forth between supporters of former President Goodluck Jonathan and President Muhammadu Buhari. While supporters of the latter lauded him on the completion of the project, supporters of the former took every moment to remind us that Jonathan started the project. One would think the nation comes first for these lots, but alas.

Poor funding of policies and clarity of purpose are also part of the factors responsible for policy failures in Nigeria. The failure of leaders to take into account the "what", "why" and "how", and the financial implications that come with driving good policies is why most of these policies become dead on arrival. 

Although initiating public policy is sometimes a difficult task, the overriding challenge is the institutional willpower to see through policy decisions. Institutional willpower is absolutely necessary if Nigeria is to gain an equal degree of functionality and relevance in the implementation of public policy. 
"The lack of cohesion and common purpose among elected officials is holding Nigeria back. In countries like South Korea, the government adopted a consistent and harmonious approach towards an industrial policy for over five decades; enabling them to achieve a level of growth that is often cited as "miraculous".There is no doubt that the Nigerian government is capable of formulating sound policies, but implementation still remains the Achilles heel of the country" – Stephannie Adinde.

Leaders have this optimistic feeling when formulating policies but as time goes on, there seems to be a shift in the original plan which results in complexities resulting in the slow and painful death of such policies.

There need to be proper measures put in place to ensure policies do not start and end on paper. Policies must be thought through, considering the pros and cons. One bad policy can take a nation centuries to recover from it.
