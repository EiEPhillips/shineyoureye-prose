Insecurity can be likened to a terminal disease, slowly eating its way into the system of the country. It stifles economic growth, stability and development. It constitutes threat to lives and properties, hinders commercial activities, and discourages local and foreign investors. 

Many young promising Nigerians have fled the country for safer climes because, according to them, money cannot save you in Nigeria. Many multinational companies have left the country. 

A country where Judges and politicians are being kidnapped and huge ransoms are being paid; a country where the health sector is in a comatose; a country where security officials who are meant to protect citizens, take their lives instead; a country where ethnicity has eaten deep into her bowels. Oh Nigeria! One begins to wonder what the fate of the common man would be if the elites are not safe.

Politicians in Nigeria want to win elections and remain in office at all cost, this has been responsible for electoral and political violence and general insecurity in Nigeria.

In Nigeria, there is the ongoing and persistent cry for equity in resource control and revenue sharing by certain resource-rich groups which have led to violent agitations among the contending actors and between the state and proponents resulting in general insecurity in Nigeria.

There is a general perception of marginalization by a section of Nigerian people in areas of government development policies, political patronage, and these serve as triggers of disaffection, resentment, and revolt.

From ethnic and religious differences, weak security system, terrorism, unemployment to corruption, poor economy, weak border control, uneven distribution of resources, etcâ€¦The list could go on and on but we are tired of identifying what these problems are if we are not willing to make conscious efforts towards curbing them.

One of the ways to tackle insecurity is to strengthen our weak security system. This weak security system can be attributed to a number of factors which include corruption, inadequate funding of the police and other security agencies, lack of modern equipment, poor welfare of security personnel, and inadequate personnel. 

There is the need for government to be proactive in dealing with security issues and threats, through modern methods of intelligence gathering, and intelligence sharing, training, logistics, motivation, and deploying advanced technology in managing security challenge

Another way is by creating an economy with relevant social, economic and physical infrastructure for business operations and industrial growth which also results in gainful employment.

Corruption is bad not because money and benefits change hands in an unjust manner, and not because of the motives of participants, but because it privatizes valuable aspects of public life, bypassing processes of representation, debate, and choice.

Furthermore, there is the need for the Nigerian government, at all levels, to ensure that poverty is reduced and a realistic social security programme is pursued and implemented to ensure that the populace meet their basic needs.
