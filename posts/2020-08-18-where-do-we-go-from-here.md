title: Where Do We Go From Here?
---
My heart is heavy, my spirit dampened. With each ticking second, the zeal to keep faith and hope alive decreases. The nation is on autopilot...who will take the wheel? Where do we go from here? The country has been left to run its course with no direction from our leaders. State governors now perform presidential functions and citizens have been left to their fate.

Since 2009, when Boko Haram began its terror campaign, thousands of citizens have either been killed, maimed or displaced. The current administration was elected with the hope that it would fulfil one of its campaign promises which is to curb insecurity but alas, it persists at an alarming rate. The economic and social activities in the country have been paralyzed. For a nation not at war, we are being killed daily. No...wait, we are at war! How do we get out of this quagmire?

So far, the de-radicalization strategy has proven to be a waste of resources. How can you absorb ex-terrorists into the society on claims that they had been reoriented? How do you want them to interact with those who have lost loved ones to terrorism? Do killers not face the law again? A petty thief gets jail term but a coldblooded killer gets a free pass. How did we get here?

For a nation abundantly blessed in human, natural and material resources, Nigeria is slowly losing the potentials of becoming great. These endowments are not well harnessed and utilised. Our leaders, instead of devoting their mental and physical capacities to governance, are seeking their own interests. Nigerians bear the excruciating burden of being ruled by politicians who simply care less about them. The burden is increased when they have to listen to religious leaders who whip up emotions and deceive congregations by using the name of God, claiming visions and miracles. They do not care about their legacy, they care only about the power they wield, the wealth they display, and above all, the pleasure and affluence they seek. They would rather take from citizens than releasing a fraction of their wealth for the benefit of all.

The government cannot keep banking on the ingenuity of Nigerians to fend for themselves and cover up governmental shortcomings. The crisis at hand cannot be resolved with private ingenuity. The government needs to step in. Let us avert this disaster seeking what good governance is. The time for excuses and half-measures is long past. The buck doesn't just stop at the government. The citizenry must also be ready to make this desired transformation possible, as agents of change and impetus for nation-building, as an epitome of discipline, integrity and patriotism. 

How can we restore peace to our country and provide safety and security for our people? We need to take a critical look at the situation we are in and offer suggestions on the way out. What needs to be done?  We have to start all over again. We have to re-engineer Nigeria. We have to reinvent Nigeria.  We have to go back to the national drawing board and create a brand-new Nigeria. We need to sit down as people through our representatives and decide what exactly we want to achieve as a nation and how to go about achieving this. One thing is for certain, we cannot continue like this!
