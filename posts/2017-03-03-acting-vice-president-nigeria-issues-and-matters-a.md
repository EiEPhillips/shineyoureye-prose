Amongst all things, one good thing we need to appreciate about Nigeria is the observation of constitutionalism, which is the strict adherence to the provisions of the constitution. For close to 3 months now, President Muhammad Buhari left for the United Kingdom on the grounds of health issues. As a considerate leader, he immediately delegated powers to his Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, on the capacity of an Acting President.  

Since then, the media(traditional & digital) has been filled with different reactions and all. Funny enough, most of them are of encomiums. He deserves some of them actually. But it got to the stage at which people started comparing the effectiveness of the president and his Vice. Like it was reiterated before now, we need to recognize the fact that the Acting President has taken some drastic and developmental measures that has lifted the spirit of Nigerians. 

Retrospectively, he had to leave the World Economic Forum to lead a 7-hour meeting with the Federal Executive Council members, which came as a surprise to many people. Subsequently, he visited and commissioned various projects at the South eastern region of the country especially in Rivers state which the President obviously has issues with. He also set up a crucial committee which had the outlook of solving the increased rise in the prices of goods and services. A key decision was a directive to the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emefiele to review the country’s foreign exchange policy which seems to be yieldingresults at the moment, judging from the Naira value appreciation over the Dollar. The result has confirmed the hopes that Nigerians have in this present administration.

On the issue of Separation of Power, Osinbajo had also forwarded the name of the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria; Walter Oonneghen to the Senate for confirmation contrary to the Buhari’s perceived reluctance since appointing the CJN in acting capacity in November, 2016. Justice Oonneghen has long since been confirmed as the Chief Justice of Nigeria. He also visited the major Airport in Lagos which led to the dismissal of some top aviation officers. 

We need to state the obvious, Osibanjo is still under Buhari. For emphasis, this is still the Buhari’s administration. In quick reaction, the presidency has also frowned at the speculation tending to score the performance of the Acting President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo higher than that of President Muhammadu Buhari, saying it was a calculated mischief to cause a division in the current administration.

At this point, Nigerians should stop placing the Acting President on a pedestal that he didn’t place himself. It is becoming as if the encomiums are ploys to break the ruling party which will ultimately divide the administration. We should rather look into making the administration run successfully thus, making the common man on the street happy to be a Nigerian. If there is any need to chastise the government, all of them should be included and vice versa.

On the other hand, the Acting President should distance himself from those who are happy in creating division in the administration in the name of praising his efforts. He has been doing exceptionally well, no doubt, but a lot needs to be done.

We wish the President quick recovery,

God bless the Federal republic of Nigeria.
