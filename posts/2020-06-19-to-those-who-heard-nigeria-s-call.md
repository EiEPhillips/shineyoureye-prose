title: To Those Who Heard Nigeria's Call
---
The first line of the first stanza of the Nigeria National Anthem, "...Nigeria's call obey", depicts a call to action, one which our forefathers clearly understood and made an unforgettable impact.

Democracy day was set aside to mark the start of the Fourth Republic (1999 - present). Democracy Day traces back to May 29, 1999, the inauguration day of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo as a civilian President, ending Nigeria's dalliance with military rule. Many point to June 12, 1993, a date associated with 'Nigeria's most free and fair election' as a worthier date to celebrate. In some quarters and states like Lagos, whose leadership believed in MKO Abiola's mandate, June 12 was marked as Democracy Day. Other states like Osun, Ogun, and Oyo had also marked June 12 as Democracy Day, depending on who was governor.

On June 6, 2018, eight days after May 29, 2018, had been celebrated as Democracy Day, the President Buhari administration declared June 12 to be the new Democracy Day. This was done to commemorate the democratic election of MKO Abiola on June 12, 1993, in what has been adjudged to be Nigeria's freest and fairest elections. It was, however, cancelled by the Ibrahim Babangida Junta. MKO Abiola was later arrested after he declared himself the president and died in jail.

**MKO Abiola (1937 - 1998)**

He was a legend on two major fronts among others. First, through his phenomenal philanthropy, he remained till today one of the most outstanding altruistic Nigerian and if he had done nothing else he would still have been remembered in the annals of great people on our continent. But he added the second great feat; he paid the supreme price in the fight for his mandate..

The military authorities did all that they could to buy-off that mandate but Abiola would not budge. He was incarcerated for many years, held incommunicado, subjected to harrowing experience, legally prosecuted, but he refused to succumb. He would simply not exchange his mandate for personal freedom.

**Frank Ovie Kokori**

Kokori earned his time in that Borno State jail for leading oil workers to demand that Nigeria’s then military dictator, General Sani Abacha, relinquish power to civilians. He led NUPENG to sustain the struggle for the restoration of the June 12 mandate of Nigeria’s undeclared president-elect, M.K.O. Abiola.

**Tafawa Balewa (1912 - 1966)**

He was both a defender of northern special interests and an advocate of reform and Nigerian unity. He was made the first Prime Minister of Nigeria and as part of his plans to unify the country towards the move for independence in 1960, he formed a coalition government between the NPC and the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC), led by Nnamdi Azikiwe.

He was an important leader in the formation of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and creating a cooperative relationship with French-speaking African countries.

**Chief Obafemi Awolowo (March 1909 – May 1987)**

He was a nationalist and a statesman who played a key role in Nigeria’s independence. He is remembered as the outstanding first premier of the Western Region but was also a successful federal commissioner for finance and vice president of the Federal Executive Council during the Civil War. He was the first Leader of Government Business and Minister of Local Government and Finance, and first Premier of the Western Region under Nigeria’s parliamentary system, from 1952 to 1959.

Beginning from the eve of independence, he led the Action Group as the Leader of the Opposition in the federal parliament and although he didn’t win the 1979 and 1983 presidential elections, he had the second-highest number of votes. He introduced free primary education and free health care in the Southwest of Nigeria and also built the Liberty Stadium in Ibadan.

**Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe (November 1904 – May 1996)**

He was one of the leading figures of modern Nigerian nationalism. He was the first President of Nigeria, from 1 October 1963 to 16 January 1966. He also served as the second and last Governor-General from 1960 to 1963. He promoted pro-African nationalist agenda while he worked as an editor for African Morning Post. He became the first Nigerian to be named to the privy council of the United Kingdom.

**Kudirat Abiola (1951 – June 1996)**

She was the wife of MKO Abiola and a first lady in the making who was ripped off before her time. At 21, she married Chief Moshood Abiola and they had seven children together. Kudirat adopted many social causes and was to become a prime supporter of the educational programs of the Ansar-Ur-Deen movement in Nigeria.
She was an activist and was very much involved in the oil workers 12-week strike against the military. The strike was the longest recorded in the African history of oil workers and it really got to the government. She was also part of the march for freedom that took place in 1995 and she won the Woman of the Year award in the same year and the previous one. She was assassinated by unknown men on Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. That event brought an end to her brilliant and bold life.

**Chief Anthony Enahoro (July 1923 – December 2010)**

He was Nigeria’s foremost anti-colonial and pro-democracy activists. He was the youngest editor in Nigeria and the first to move the motion for Nigeria’s independence and was usually referred to as the “Father of the Nigerian State”. He was an academician and fought for the good cause of the nation until his death in late 2010.

**Gani Fawehinmi**
