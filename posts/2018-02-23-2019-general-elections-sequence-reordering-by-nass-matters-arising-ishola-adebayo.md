  2019 General Elections Sequence Reordering by NASS: Matters Arising! -Ishola

The National Assembly Conference Committee on Electoral Act (amendment) Bill last week Tuesday adopted the reordered sequence of the 2019 General Elections, making presidential election last. It may be recalled that the House of Representatives had few weeks ago, began process to amend the Electoral Act 2010 with the inclusion of section 25(1) in the law.

This was to reorder the sequence of the elections, to commence with National Assembly, followed by governorship and State House of Assembly, and Presidential as last. This is against the sequence rolled out by Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) late 2017, which put Presidential and National Assembly elections first and governorship and state assembly to follow.

No doubt, if the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) wants to conduct free, fair and credible elections in the country devoid of rigging, the commission should listen to the voice of the representatives of the Nigerian people, who are working hard to reduce bandwagon effects in voting.

 Members of the National Assembly are not only experienced lawmakers but major stakeholders in the outcome of the elections. We don't put in place an electoral process in place with one man in mind because if another person comes in, the process will be inherited by the person. 
 
The process should be to do the right thing and follow the path that can deepen democracy rather than a party that will ultimately destroy all democratic tenets we have all labour to build. The reordered election is the best thing the current National Assembly has done for Nigeria and democracy in the country.  Anyone against it is a hater of Nigerian democracy. The issue is not about President Muhammadu Buhari's re-election bid. It is about Nigeria after President Buhari.

It is hope that politicians in Nigeria will work together to save democracy and unite the county rather than working for selfish purposes, with destruction as its end.
