"...to build a nation where peace and justice shall reign". 

Oh, what lofty dreams our forefathers had! The last line of the second stanza of the Nigerian anthem depicts the Nigeria they looked forward to. The question is, are we there yet?

Before we proceed to the crux of the matter, what is Nation building? Simply put, It is the process of establishing civic order and governmental functions in countries that are emerging from a period of war or other types of upheaval.

Nation building involves conscious efforts to inculcate in the citizens a sense of common identity as a member of a given state. It is a psychological process of mind reconstruction to elicit in the citizensâ€™ attitudes and dispositions that make for the good health of the nation. According to Wikipedia, nation building aims at the unification of the people within the state so that it remains politically stable and viable in the long run.

A strong and powerful nation is built on the dedication and hard work of its citizen and some amount of smart planning on the part of the Government. There are various facets of nation building among which the most important ones at this moment in time seems to be the tapping the potential of its human resource, reducing the social and economic disparity that exists in the society and creating an enabling environment, wherein individuals can live freely and attain their best in life.

You see, in a country like Nigeria, it would seem easier on paper than in actual realization, a nation void of ethnic sentiments and colonial mindset. The country is still as divided as ever despite concerted efforts to cement ethnic cracks. From the incessant battle with Boko Haram insurgents in the north-eastern part of the country to militancy in the Niger Delta region. Let us not forget the agitation of the eastern part for the independence of the sovereign state of Biafra and the insurgency of the Fulani herdsmen which has become a never-ending nightmare. These ill factors cannot allow for the common national identity which nation building requires to flourish.

To forge ahead, we need to stabilize the nation by offering humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in areas that are affected by the insurgency, rebuild the infrastructure, and jump-start the economy. We also need to create self-sustaining political and economic institutions that will ultimately permit competent democratic governance and economic growth. This transition to self-sustaining development is far more challenging, and it is even more important in the long run. The keyword is "self-sustaining".

Building a nation means creating or repairing all the cultural, social, and historical ties that bind us together as a nation and this is not something that can be done by outsiders. What we are really talking about is state-building, that is, creating or strengthening such government institutions as armies, police forces, judiciaries, central banks, tax-collection agencies, health and education systems, and the like.

I promise you, this will not be a walk in the park. Great things take time and effort. We may not be there yet but who says we can't work towards it and achieve it?
