More than 45 days after President Muhammadu Buhari mounted the saddle for a second term in office, it has become obvious that his style of governance would not change anytime soon.

With members of the National Assembly scheduled to begin their eight-week annual recess this month even if President Muhammadu Buhari fails to submit the list of his ministerial nominees for their consideration and approval.

There are also indications that the red chamber will not delay the commencement of their recess on July 26 because of the list.

Buhari has yet to constitute his cabinet more than four months after winning the February 23 presidential election.

Sources said a deep-seated tug-of-war between two camps --one led by North-West governor and another led by key member of President Buhari's kitchen cabinet-- is delaying the much-expected list.

Caught in the middle of these contending forces, and his desire to go solo on the issue of nominating would be cabinet members, the President is already forced to thread the similar route that cost him six months before setting up a proper executive governance structure in place in his first term.

While he remained flummoxed by the tug of war among disparate economic and political interests, loyalists from the various camps floated fictitious lists that were short of setting a pattern for the President that is, otherwise, putting words into his mouth.

However, the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina was quoted to have said: "Nigerians will not have to wait a day longer than necessary before they have a cabinet. And as the president himself has said the process won't take as long as it did in 2015, because the circumstances are not the same."

Indeed, the circumstances are not the same so also are the challenges. But for the tussle between the governor and the president's close aide, the list would have been ready.

However, it is to be seen if the president would yield to the governor or a member of his kitchen cabinet. He is likely to submit the list next week.

Indeed, sources said the list, which is closely guarded by the president, is ready and would be submitted soon.
