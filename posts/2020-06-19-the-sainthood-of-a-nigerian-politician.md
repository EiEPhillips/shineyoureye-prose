title: The Sainthood Of A Nigerian Politician

“Whoever comes to equity must come with clean hands” is a maxim befitting for a Nigerian politician. It tells them that if they are guilty of wrongdoing, they should not approach equity for relief.

The Nigerian version of what people call politics lacks any iota of morality. Interestingly, but sadly, some politicians want you to believe that they are saints. They demonise others and appear sanctimonious. In their myopic minds, they are the saints.

Well, let us start from the sainthood, or lack of it, of our politicians. Who is a saint? In my opinion, the saint we should be looking for is somebody who does ordinary things in an extraordinary way. A saint is not somebody without sin or faults. If it were so, heaven would be empty because if our guilt were to be marked, how many Nigerians would survive?

There is no best time to see the hypocrisy of Nigerian leaders than now when politicians are hiding under the camouflage of ‘massism’ to pitch their tents where the interests of their inner caucus can be best served, protected and entrenched. The ultimate concern is the political worth calculated in terms of the number of votes the new ‘player’ can bring to the club to win the champions league.

Undoubtedly, politics in Nigeria at all levels and in every political party is based mostly on personal and inter-personal interests and considerations. In fact, hardly do people who enter politics do so with the objective to serve the nation but to serve themselves. I ask, how many Nigerian politicians at every level have resigned from their either elected or appointed positions due to their incompetence or corruption allegations?

Despite their homily on having the interests of the masses at heart, most of our politicians and public officers have abused their positions and a very high number of them do not have the fear of God even if they go to church to kneel before their pastors every Sunday or visit mosques for prayers every day. They have an appearance or form of godliness but their hearts are far from God.

These politicians come on air and blame everyone, but themselves. They appoint themselves as anti-corruption crusaders. Their children drive the best cars and attend the most expensive universities abroad. They even arrange marriages for their children so that they can keep the loot within their small circles. When the people complain, they hand out peanuts to quench their hunger and move on as if nothing matters. These saints have never worked in their lives. They have no known or functional businesses. They are anything, but savvy. Yet, they have amassed so much wealth that it will take a local government to draw from it for a century before their purses will run dry.

Buhari was repackaged into sainthood wearing a messianic robe. Even in his Chatham House speech, he said he had become a converted democrat. Many Nigerians have consistently remained supportive and convinced that Buhari is the best to tackle "sinful" acts of corruption. Well, if his definition of fighting corruption is clamping down on perceived opposition, then, he needs to go back to the drawing board.

You cannot portray an image of one who has zero-tolerance for corruption yet turn a blind eye when that corruption is being perpetrated by those in your caucus. You can’t enjoy the largesse and pretend to be a saint. In Orubebe’s voice "we will not take this". There are no saints among thieves; they are all sinners.

But in reality, there are no saints in politics. Every Nigerian politician has sinned and has fallen short of the glory of God. So, let no one deceive you.

Okay then. Let’s talk about Saint Shehu Sani, a former ‘comrade’ and senator that represented Kaduna Central in the 8th Senate.

A former Saint Sani, revealed in an interview with TheNews magazine: ‎“I think what we can say is that the running cost of a senator is N13.5 million every month.” This implies that 109 Senators receive N1.47 billion monthly.

For folks like me, the issue with legislator’s pay package is allowances and not published salaries. As citizens, we need to be careful of the kind of politicians we elect to office. Despite they are not saints, we need to choose the best out of them. We should vote for politicians based on these 5Cs - competence, character, compassion, capacity, and courage.
