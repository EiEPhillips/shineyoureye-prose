On Tuesday, 4th October, 2016; Enough Is Enough Nigeria (EiE) with other partner organizations started the #Office of the Citizen radio programme that had been in the making over sometime in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. Thanks to Sweet 107.1FM crew, especially Mr. Toye Arulogun and Olaitan Bakare, we finally got a 60-minute weekly slot to discuss various issues that are of great concern to Nigerians in English and Yoruba Language.

These issues may revolve around Access to Power, holding public officials accountable, getting good services from government and privately owned agencies, and other topical issues that may be relevant to the host community. We hope that every listener will soon believe that the Office of the Citizen they occupy is actually the highest office in the land!

Unlike other call-in programs, the distinguishing factor of the ‘Office of the Citizen’ radio show would be its singular objective of educating listeners and helping callers solve problems related to the focus areas. Callers will be allowed to vent, but ultimately, the focus will be on how to help them turn their anger/frustrations into action and results.

Every Tuesday from 11am-12noon, EiE in partnership with Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC) and BudgIT will discuss various governance - related issues including engaging government officials, budgets, gender based violence and other women’s rights abuse.

Guests on the first episode were Ishola Adebayo of EiE Nigeria, Emmanuela Azu of WARDC and ‘Funso Oladapo of BudgIT Nigeria. Alongside our wonderful co-hosts Akinwande Ogundele and Ayinla Egba. We took our listeners on a 1-hour ride through the overview of the show and of course issues around Local Government Administration in Nigeria and the forthcoming LGAs/LCDA elections in Ogun State. 

Join us every Tuesday by 11am on SWEET 107.1 FM as we take on topical issues of concern to Nigerians. Tweet with the hashtag #OfficeOfTheCitizen or call in: 09020931071, 09020941071, 08148444994 to join the conversation!
