Mrs. Aisha Buhari, wife of the President and First Lady of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, can’t be confined to “the Kitchen, the living room or the other room”, whatever her husband, President Muhammadu Buhari, says. It already appears one can’t keep a pretty, ambitious woman down, even if you are President of the most populous black nation on earth.

Nigeria’s First Lady, Aisha Buhari unforgettable interview spoilt one of her husband’s rare promising moments—Boko Haram’s release of twenty-one Chibok schoolgirls. In a BBC Hausa interview, she expressed her displeasure in President Buhari’s government, saying that the President does not know most of the appointees in his cabinet and that PMB’s government is currently been controlled by the Aso Villa Cabals. She succinctly emphasized that the Presidency had been hijacked by a few people, who were behind the presidential appointments.

In the interview, Mrs. Buhari said, “The president does not know 45 out of 50, for example, of the people he appointed and I don’t know them either, despite being his wife of 27 years. Some people are sitting down in their homes, folding their arms, only for them to be called to come and head an agency or a ministerial position.”

With this media outburst from Nigeria’s First Lady, somebody we believe should know her husband too well. It therefore paint the clear picture that a good number of people in the President’s cabinet are misfits and square pegs forcing themselves into round holes. So to that extent, I agree that a lot of the cabinet members should simply give way. What if a man who says he is not corrupt is incompetent, what good is he to us?

Nigerians are suffering, yet people are pretending as if everything is fine. The value of naira has dropped by 70 per cent over one year, yet President Buhari and his cabinet members are still blaming the previous administration.

President Buhari no doubt confirmed his wife’s depiction of a man who is so bewildered by the demands of his office that he has ceded control to others in his graceless response which of course the Presidency handlers had effortlessly tried to pass off as witticism.
