Within two (2) years into the current 8th National Assembly, about four (4) federal lawmakers are facing the recall process largely because of their failure to engage with the citizens at their respective constituencies while in Abuja for the primary purpose of representation and lawmaking for the nation.

**DINO MELAYE**
What do they say is his crime? The constituents, led by one Cornelius Olowo, said the move to recall Melaye is based on his “abysmal performance”. For the past two years, Dino Melaye representing the people of Kogi West Senatorial District under the platform of the APC has not organized one town hall meeting anywhere in his District to meet with the people to present his scorecard or stewardship.  The ‘Ajekun Iya’ senator has however asked the court to issue an order of injunction restraining INEC from commencing the process of his recall.

**SUNNI OGBUOJI**
In the case of Senator Sunni Ogbuoji of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who represents Ebonyi South Senatorial Districts in the Senate. His constituents alleged him of “Criminal abandonment of his Senatorial Districts” and already gave him three (3) months to become more responsive.

**BOLARINWA BAMIDELE**
Bolarinwa, a serving member of House of Representatives, representing the people of Idanre/Ifedore Federal Constituency, in Ondo State under the ruling party, APC. After several media tussles between him, the youth of the constituency and the party elders no recall process has been initiated yet. It is hope that the youth will active the office of the citizen they occupy and demand accountability and good representation. 

**SULAIMAN HUNKUNYI**
On the list also is Mr. Sulaiman Hunkunyi, the Senator representing Kaduna North Senatorial District on the same APC ticket.  Whose constituents had reportedly alleged loss of confidence in his ability to represent his senatorial district at the National Assembly. Signatures of constituents’ gathered so far not yet up to the required amount by INEC and process already marred with insinuations of alleged threat to life as reported on several media channels. 

Will any of the legislators join the league of lucky lawmakers who had in recent times escaped recall or have their names go into the history book as the first set of lawmakers to be sacked by the citizens? Only time, will tell.
