Competence is the ability to do something successfully or efficiently. It is the possession of required skill, knowledge, qualification, or capacity for a defined role or duty. 

Time and time again, people have said: "we do not want old people at the helm of affairs in our political space anymore, we want young people". These words are valid. To their credit, we witnessed how young Nigerians took charge of the administrative aspect of the #EndSARS protests, disbursing funds to those in need, rendering pro bono legal services, providing healthcare assistance to the injured, and ensuring that street protesters were well fed – not forgetting airtime giveaways for online protesters. All these were achieved by the youths without aid from the government. 

Looking back, one has a glimpse of what a Nigeria run by the youths would look like...but, does being young equal competence? If the protests had extended beyond October, would the supposed foolproof structure of the #EndSARS administrators have crumbled? Would they have borrowed a leaf from the older generation?

Political power is too cumbersome for its intending wielders to base its criterion for access on age alone. Note: keyword is "alone". If it was by being a youth alone, the likes of Elisha Abbo who physically assaulted a woman at an adult toy shop, and Desmond Elliot who justified the #SocialMediaBill – to name a few – are clearly not the type of PR the youths need. Instead, the focus should be on possessing the 5Cs which are Character, Compassion, Capacity, Courage and **Competence**.

‘Character’ which serves as their mental and moral orientation, and forms the core of their persona; ‘Compassion’ which stems from their empathy and propels them to go the extra mile; ‘Capacity’ which ensures they are not only mentally, physically and emotionally able to meet the needs of citizens but that they possess the necessary skills; ‘Courage’ which gives the boldness to confront challenges head-on and take favourable decisions without batting an eyelid; and ‘Competence’ as earlier defined.

The focus should be on identifying individuals with these attributes and electing them. Selecting the right candidate transcends the age and the willingness to run, it takes experience and competence to deliver. If you are a youth hoping to run for office, start small. The grassroot is a better place to test the tides.

For a demographic that is largely marginalized from political processes and seeks inclusion in various decision-making processes, the Nigerian youth are beginning to wake up and smell the coffee – they just need a nudge in the right direction.
