Despite persistent outcry by active citizens for #OurNASS to open its financial books to the public, the National Assembly on Thursday, May 11, successfully published details of its 2017 budget.

The NASS shared a document of the budget which amounted to N125 billion. A budget of N125 billion ($409 million) for a house whose total population is 469 members can be adjudged to be bogus and unpatriotic.

Findings revealed that the National Assembly 2017 budget is larger than that of some states in the country. For a more appropriate description, the budget is larger than a combination of 2017 budgets of two states in Nigeria (Nassarawa – 67.103 b, Anambra – 58.9 b among other states budget that could be peered).

The National Assembly is regarded as one of the world’s most expensive when measured against the standard of living of an average Nigerian, and the government’s total revenue and spending. 

The N125 billion spending for 2017 is three percent of the entire federal budget, while the United States, for instance, spent only 0.17 percent of its total budget to run its Congress the same year.

If efficiency will begin in government, the National Assembly has to show example as the highest organ of accountability. Why so much money for photocopiers, vehicles, insurance, legal services, travels and training? 

Some people are of the opinion that the national assembly is too expensive to maintain. They even advocate it should be reduced to part time duties, others assert it should be scrapped and I just wonder why some people lack sense of humor. All the walk outs, the grammars, the back and forth decisions, the quarrels and the fights are simply enough to relieve us of the pains of recession.

If National Assembly spends N7.7bn on cars at an average of N25m each, that’s 300 cars. Is National Assembly planning to do Uber car hire service? Why is the National Assembly spending ten times the budget of a university and a teaching hospital? Why do legislative aides earn more than the entire personnel cost of a university in Nigeria? 

Active Citizens, #AskQuestions!
