title: What To Do With All The Anger
---
Are you frustrated with the back and forth of the government on #EndSARS? Are you tired of political name bashing and mud-slinging? Are you tired of the braggadocio and grandstanding attitude of some politicians’ self-anointed superiority? There’s a lot to be angry about, and it can feel overwhelming. So, what can you do to harness your "angry energy"?

Simply develop an action plan

There are several ways you could go about converting the energy into something impactful:

1. **Contact your elected officials:** one way to use your anger for good is by using your voice. Remember, your elected officials are supposed to be accountable to you. If you are upset about things at the national level, contact the executive branch of your government. You can also contact state and local officials. You can find their contact details on www.shineyoureye.org. Let them know your opinions on issues and hold them accountable for their bill sponsorship and political actions. A simple two-minute call, text or email, per week, to your senators and representatives, needs to be a part of your weekly to-do list.

2. **Vote:** For you to bring back civility and accountability to the political arena, you must vote in every election. You can decide the 2023 election by voting.

3. **Choose a cause and make a donation:** You can focus on specific political issues. A great way to do this is by making a monetary donation. Look for organizations like EiE Nigeria, that will address the issue that you are upset about. Volunteer for an organization you are passionate about. You don’t have to give money. Donating your time is also a great way to make an impact!

4. **Run for office:** You can make a difference by becoming part of your government. Consider running for a local position to get started. Maybe you are worried about your LGA so you choose to run chairmanship.

5. **Lend your voice** and educate citizens online and offline.

There has been a lot of big political changes in Nigeria recently. You might be feeling some strong emotions about certain elected officials or new laws that have been passed mid-protests. If you’re feeling angry, that’s normal. What’s important is that you deal with that anger instead of letting it consume you. Find a positive way to channel your energy, engage in constructive conversations, and most importantly, take care of your physical and mental health!

Anger is an emotion that is capable of motivating people to engage in political action. The trick is in not allowing the energy to go to waste. If there is one thing the **#EndSARS** protests has thought us, it's that we need just the right amount of anger to take action. Let us strike the rod while it is hot and make the most of this awakening in the youths and the society at large.
