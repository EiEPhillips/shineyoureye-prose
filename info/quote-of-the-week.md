_“I urge you to lend your voice to the call for greater participation in the political process that will lead to enthroning the right people in leadership positions. It is a civic responsibility and a process that we all must involve in, and this process starts with the registration for and obtaining our Permanent Voter Cards, which is the only way to vote in credible leaders.”_

   **Gov. Akinwunmi Ambode (Governor of Lagos State)**
