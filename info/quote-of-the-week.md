_“The leaders there today will vacate the place tomorrow so if you the youths don’t start preparing today by getting mentored and learning the ropes, there is no way you will perform very well if the mantle of leadership falls on you tomorrow. So, there is need for you to go in there and participate”._

   **Prof. Yemi Osinbajo (Vice President of Nigeria)**
