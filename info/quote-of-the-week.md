_“This country can be well run because we produce the best in every way, but it will take a lot of work by good men and women. This is what I have learnt over two years here. If we do the right things, day by day, we will change and improve the Nigerian situation significantly.”_

   **Prof. Yemi Osinbajo(Acting President of Nigeria)**
