_“It is clear that governors have to think beyond four or eight year’s cycle. There must be a commitment to laying a foundation that our successors will build on. One of the challenges with governance today in Nigeria is the penchant for dismantling or dismissing everything inherited.”_

   **Prof. Yemi Osinbajo (Vice President of Nigeria)**
