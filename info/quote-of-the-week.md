_"The Dapchi and Chibok pupils are our girls and must enjoy our protection. They must live to achieve their individual ambitions; to be great women of tomorrow. It is our duty to protect them. We are determined to restore peace to all parts of the country – from the West to the East; North to the South.”_

   **President Muhammadu Buhari (President of Nigeria)**
