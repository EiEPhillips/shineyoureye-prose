Shine your Eye is an initiative of [Enough is Enough Nigeria (EiE Nigeria)](https://www.eienigeria.org "EiENigeria"). It helps you find the elected officials that represent you at all tiers of government and connect with them. Their profiles include educational background, experience, social media accounts, phone numbers, and email addresses.

Our goal is to increase accountability in governance by making it easier for Nigerians to connect with their elected officials. The initial site was built by mySociety, a UK-based organization that build technology platforms to facilitate citizen engagement.

SYE partners with [Tracka](https://tracka.ng/ "Tracka"), a [BudgIT](https://yourbudgit.com/ "BudgIT") project, to promote transparency and accountability of constituency projects in Nigeria. The objective is to encourage citizens to engage their legislators to perform their oversight functions effectively and ensure proper execution of allocated constituency projects.
